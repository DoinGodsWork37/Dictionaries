PETRARCH Dictionary Formats
===========================

**This branch includes a major reorganization of the Petrarch dictionaries. The objective of this reorganization is to ensure that all the relevant dictionary entries are available to Petrarch and to make it much more intuitive to add entries in the future.** 

There are five separate input dictionaries or lists that PETRACH makes use of:
the verb dictionary, the actor dictionary, the agent dictionary, the discard
list, and the issues list. The following sections describe these files in
greater detail. In addition to this documentation, which is intended for individuals 
planning to work on dictionaries, the source code contains internal documentation on
how the dictionary information is stored by the program.

The PETRARCH dictionaries are generally derived from the earlier TABARI dictionaries, 
and information on those formats can be found in the TABARI manual: 

`http://eventdata.parusanalytics.com/tabari.dir/TABARI.0.8.4b2.manual.pdf <http://eventdata.parusanalytics.com/tabari.dir/TABARI.0.8.4b2.manual.pdf>`_

'dev' branch
------------------------------

This is the 'dev' (development) branch of this repro, which is where dictionaries 
reside during a testing phase before they are incorporated into the pipeline.

General Rules for dictionaries
------------------------------

All of the files are in "flat ASCII" format and should only be edited using a program that produces a a file without embedded control codes; for example Emacs or BBEdit.

**Comments in input files:**

Comments should be delineated in either Python or XML style (which is inherited from HTML which 
inherited it from SGML) are allowed, as long as you don't get too clever. Basically, 
anything that looks like any of these is treated like a comment and skipped.

::

	<!-- [comment] -->
	
	things I want to actually read <!-- [comment] -->
	
	some things I want <!-- [comment] --> and more of them
	
	<!-- start of the comment
	\[1 or more additional lines\]
	end of the comment -->
	
	# this is a Python-like comment, inherited from Unix
	
	something I want # followed by a Python-like comment

 

For the HTML-like comments,  the system doesn't use the formal definition that also says '--' is not allowed 
inside a comment: it just looks for --> as a terminator

The program is *not* set up to handle clever variations like nested comments,  multiple 
comments on a line, or non-comment information in multi-line comments: yes, we are
perfectly capable of writing code that could handle these contingencies, but it 
is not a priority at the moment. We trust you can cope within these limits.

Blank lines and lines with only whitespace are also skipped.

For legacy purposes, anything following ';' is treated as a comment: this is the old KEDS/TABARI formatting rule and TABARI actor dictionaries still more or less work.



Verb Dictionary
---------------

The verb dictionary consists of a set of synsets followed by a series of verb 
synonyms and patterns.

**Verb Synonym Blocks and Patterns:**

A verb synonym block is a set of verbs which are synonymous (or close enough) with 
respect to the patterns. The program automatically generates the regular forms of the 
verb if it is regular (and, implicitly, English); otherwise the irregular forms can be 
specified in {...} following the primary verb. An optional code for the isolated verb 
can	follow in [...].  

The verb block begins with a comment of the form 

::

--- <GENERAL DESCRIPTION> [<CODE>] ---

where the "---" signals the beginning of a new block. The code in [...] is the 
primary code -- typically a two-digit+0 cue-category code -- for the block, and this 
will be used for all other verbs unless these have their own code. If no code is 
present, this defaults to the null code "---"  which indicates that the isolated verb 
does not generate an event. The null code also can be used as a secondary code.	

This is followed by a set of patterns -- these begin with '-' -- which generally 
follow the same syntax as TABARI patterns (see Chapter 5 of the TABARI manual). The pattern set is terminated with a  blank line.

**Multiple-word verbs**

Multiple-word "verbs" such as ``CONDON OFF``, ``WIRE TAP`` and ``BEEF UP`` are entered by 
connecting the word with an underscore (these must be consecutive) and putting a '+' 
in front of the verb. Alternative forms must be specified: they are not constructed 
automatically. These are treated in patterns just as single-word verbs are treated.

Example:

::

    +BEEF_UP {+BEEFS_UP +BEEFED_UP +BEEFING_UP}
    +CORDON_OFF {+CORDONED_OFF +CORDONS_OFF +CORDONING_OFF} 
    WIRE_+TAP {WIRE_+TAPPED  WIRE_+TAPPING }


**Synsets:**

Synonym sets (synsets) are labelled with a string beginning with & and defined using
the label followed by a series of lines beginning with ``+`` containing words or phrases.
The phrases are interpreted as requiring consecutive words; the words can be separated 
with either spaces or underscores (they are converted to spaces). Synset phrases can 
only contain words, not ``$``, ``+``, ``%`` or ``^`` tokens or synsets. At present, a synsets cannot  
contain another synset as an element. [see note below] Synsets be used anywhere in a  
pattern that a word or phrase can be used. A synset must be defined before it is used:  
a pattern containing an undefined synset will be ignored -- but those definitions can 
occur anywhere in the file.

Regular plurals are generated automatically  by adding 'S' to the root, adding 'IES' if the root ends in 'Y', and added 'ES' if the root ends in 'SS'.  Plurals are not created when [1]_

.. [1] The method for handling irregular plurals is currently different for the verbs and agents dictionaries: these will be reconciled in the future, probably using the agents syntax. 

* The phrase ends with ``_``. 

* The label ends with ``_``, in which case plurals are not generated for any of
  the phrases; this is typically used for synonym sets that do not involve nouns
        
The ``_`` is dropped in both cases. Irregular plurals do not have a special syntax; 
just enter these as additional synonyms.

    +DOLLARS
    +EUROS

**Verb Dictionary Differences from TABARI:**

On the **very** remote chance -- see Note 1 -- that you are trying to modify a TABARI  
.verbs dictionary to the PETRARCH format, the main thing you will need to eliminate 
any stemmed words:  PETRARCH only works with complete words. On the positive side, 
PETRARCH will only look at string as a "verb" if it has been identified as such by 
the parser, so the patterns required for noun/verb disambiguation are no longer 
needed. PATRARCH also does not allow disconjunctive sets in patterns: to accommodate 
legacy dictionaries, patterns containing these are skipped, but in order to work,
these should be replaced with synsets. Also see additional remarks at the beginning 
of the file.

The other big difference between PETRARCH and TABARI is verb-noun disambiguation: 
the pattern-based approach of TABARI needed a lot of information to insure that a 
word that **might** be a verb was, in fact, a verb (or was a noun that occurred in a 
context where it indicated an event anyway: TABARI's [in]famous tendency to code the 
right thing for the wrong reason. PETRARCH, in contrast, only looks as a verb when 
the parsing has identified it as, in fact, a verb. This dramatically reduces false 
positives and eliminates the need for any pattern which was required simply for 
disambiguation, but it also means that PETRARCH is a lot more discriminating about 
what actually constitutes an event. The big difference here is that verb-only 
codes are the norm in PETRARCH dictionaries but the exception in TABARI dictionaries.

The active PETRARCH verbs dictionary has been extensively reorganized into both 
verb and noun synonym sets, and you are probably better off adding vocabulary to 
this [see Note 1] than converting a dictionary, but it can be done. An unconverted 
TABARI dictionary, on the other hand, will generally not work at all well with 
PETRARCH.

Note 1. 

Yeah, right. Every project we've encountered -- including those funded by multiple 
millions of dollars and those allegedly producing multiple millions of events -- has 
regarded the NSF-funded CAMEO verbs dictionaries as a sacred artifact of the Data 
Fairy, lowered from Asgaard along the lines of this

`http://www.wikiart.org/en/jacob-jordaens/allegory-of-the-peace-of-westphalia-1654 <http://www.wikiart.org/en/jacob-jordaens/allegory-of-the-peace-of-westphalia-1654>`_

[not exactly sure where the .verbs file is in that painting, but I'm sure it is in  
there somewhere]

but then subsequently subject said dictionaries to bitter complaints that they aren't 
coding properly.

Look, dudes and dudettes, these dictionaries have been open source for about as long 
as the US has been at war in Afghanistan -- which is to say, a really long time -- and 
if you don't like how the coding is being done, add some new open-source vocabulary 
to the dictionaries instead of merely parasitizing the existing work. Dude.

The **real** problem, one suspects, is embodied in the following nugget of wisdom:

    Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks 
    like work.
    
        -Thomas A. Edison

Dude.

Actor Dictionary
----------------

Actor dictionaries are similar to those used in TABARI (see Chapter 5 of the manual) except that the date restrictions must be on separate lines (in TABARI, this was
optional) The general structure of the actors dictionary is a series of records of the form

::

    [primary phrase]
    [optional synonym phrases beginning with '+']
    [optional date restrictions beginning with '\t']

A "phrase string" is a set of character strings separated by either blanks or
underscores.

A "code" is a character string without blanks

A "date" has the form YYYYMMDD or YYMMDD. These can be mixed, e.g.

::

    JAMES_BYRNES_  ; CountryInfo.txt
        [USAELI 18970101-450703]
        [USAGOV 450703-470121]

**Primary phrase format:**

``phrase_string  { optional [code] }``

If the code is present, it becomes the default code if none of the date restrictions
are satisfied. If it is not present and none of the restrictions are satisfied,
this is equivalent to a null code

*Synonym phrase*

``+phrase_string``

*Date restriction*

``\t[code restriction]``

where ``\t`` is the tab character and the restriction [1]_ takes the form

::

    <date : applies to times before date
    >date : applies to times after date
    date-date: applies to times between dates

The limits of the date restrictions are interpreted as "or equal to." A date restriction of the form ``\t[code]`` is the same as a default restriction.


**Example:**

::

**Detecting actors which are not in the dictionary**

Because PETRARCH uses parsed input, it has the option of detecting actors---noun phrases---which are not in the dictionary. This is set using the ``new_actor_length`` option in the ``PETR_config.ini`` file: see the description of that file for details.

Agent Dictionary
----------------

Basic structure of the agents dictionary is a series of records of the form

::

        phrase_string {optional plural}  [agent_code]


A "phrase string" is a set of character strings separated by either blanks or
underscores. As with the verb patterns, a blank between words means that additional words can occur between the previous word and the next word; a ``_`` (underscore) means that the words must be consecutive.


An "agent_code" is a character string without blanks that is either preceded (typically)
or followed by ``~``. If the ``~`` precedes the code, the code is added after the actor
code; if it follows the code, the code is added before the actor code (usually done
for organizations, e.g. ``NGO~``)

**Plurals:**

Regular plurals -- those formed by adding 'S' to the root, adding 'IES' if the
root ends in 'Y', and added 'ES' if the root ends in 'SS' -- are generated automatically

If the plural has some other form, it follows the root inside {...}  [1]_

If a plural should not be formed -- that is, the root is only singular or only
plural, or the singular and plural have the same form (e.g. "police"), use a null
string inside {}.

If there is more than one form of the plural -- "attorneys general" and "attorneys
generals" are both in use -- just make a second entry with one of the plural forms
nulled (though in this instance -- ain't living English wonderful? -- you could null
the singular and use an automatic plural on the plural form) Though in a couple
test sentences, this phrase confused the CoreNLP parser.

**Substitution Markers:**

These are used to handle complex equivalents, notably

::

        !PERSON! = MAN, MEN, WOMAN, WOMEN, PERSON
        !MINST! = MINISTER, MINISTERS, MINISTRY, MINISTRIES

and used in the form

::

        CONGRESS!PERSON! [~LEG}
        !MINIST!_OF_INTERNAL_AFFAIRS

The marker for the substitution set is of the form !...! and is followed by an =
and a comma-delimited list; spaces are stripped from the elements of the list so
these can be added for clarity. Every item in the list is substituted for the marker,
with no additional plural formation, so the first construction would generate

::

        CONGRESSMAN [~LEG}
        CONGRESSMEN [~LEG}
        CONGRESSWOMAN [~LEG}
        CONGRESSWOMEN [~LEG}
        CONGRESSPERSON [~LEG}

    TROOP {} [~MIL] # ab 22 Aug 2005

Discard List
------------

The discard list is used to identify sentences that should not be coded, for example sports events and historical chronologies.[2]_ If the string, prefixed with ' ', is found in the ``<Text>...</Text>`` sentence, the
sentence is not coded. Prefixing the string with a '+' means the entire story is not
coded with the string is found. If the string ends with '_', the matched string must also end with
a blank or punctuation mark; otherwise it is treated as a stem. The matching is not
case sensitive.

.. [2] In TABARI, discards were intermixed in the ``.actors`` dictionary and ``.verbs`` patterns, using the ``[###]`` code. They are now a separate dictionary.

Issues List
-----------

The optional ``Issues`` dictionary is used to do simple string matching and return a comma-delimited list of codes. The standard format is simply a set of lines of the form

        ``<string> [<code>]``

For purposes of matching, a ' ' is added to the beginning and end of the string: at
present there are no wild cards, though that is easily added.

The following expansions can be used (these apply to the string that follows up to
the next blank):

::

        n: Create the singular and plural of the noun
        v: Create the regular verb forms ('S','ED','ING')
        +: Create versions with ' ' and '-'

The file format allows ``#`` to be used as a in-line comment delimiter.

Issues are written to the event record as a comma-delimited list to a tab-delimited
field, e.g.

::

    20080801	ABC	EDF	0001	POSTSECONDARY_EDUCATION 2, LITERACY 1	AFP0808-01-M008-02
    20080801	ABC	EDF	0004        AFP0808-01-M007-01
    20080801	ABC	EDF	0001	NUCLEAR_WEAPONS 1	AFP0808-01-M008-01

where ``XXXX NN``, corresponds to the issue code and the number of matched phrases in the
sentence that generated the event.

This feature is optional and triggered by a file name in the
``PETR_config.ini`` file at ``issuefile_name = Phoenix.issues.140225.txt``.

In the current code, the occurrence of an ignore phrase of either type cancels all
coding of issues from the sentence.

::

    <ISSUE CATEGORY="ID_ATROCITY">
    n:atrocity [ID_ATROCITY]
    n:genocide [ID_ATROCITY]
